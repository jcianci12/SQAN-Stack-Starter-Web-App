## StarterApp with 3rd Party login

This is a distant cousin of [QuickApp](https://github.com/emonney/QuickApp) by Eben Money.

It has alot stripped out but does implement 3rd party log ins which was missing from QuickApp. It also keeps the user management features.

Check out the [demo app](https://demoapp.tekonline.com.au) for a live run of this app.

Pull requests welcome! [Checkout the pull requests](https://github.com/jonmosco/StarterApp/pulls) and [log an issue](https://github.com/jonmosco/StarterApp/issues).

### Ready to use

Just pull it down from git and run 

docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

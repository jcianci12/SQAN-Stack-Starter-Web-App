#🦢 SQAN Stack with 3rd Party login

## It uses the MS**SQ**l, **A**ngular, and .**N**et core stack to get you started.

*This is a distant cousin of [QuickApp](https://github.com/emonney/QuickApp) by Eben Money.*

*The idea is you can pull it, run it in a docker stack and get started quick! 😉*

---

## Ready to use

Just pull it down from git and run 👨‍💻

docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
